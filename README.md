crimehack
=========

Crime Hack displays crime statistics for Australia, and was built as part of the GovHack open government competition. 

The application has a number of datasets overlayed on crime statistics in New South Wales. 

Users can see whether there is a risk of crime in a particular area based on their location. 

Secondly, they can see a correlation between certain crimes and:

- Reporting of crime, to see whether there is a disparity between truth and reporting
- Distance from public transport, to see whether public transport networks spread crime
